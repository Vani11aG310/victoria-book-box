# Project Planning

## Victoria Book Box
Victoria Book Box is a mobile-friendly website to track locations of book boxes and their current inventory. Allows users to input data about books they are adding to a box. Users can search boxes for books they may be interested in. Users can receive a notification when a book they are interested is added to the collection.

## Target Audience
Book Lovers who want access to free local book boxes to exchange their used books.

## Assumptions
People can add or remove books without going through the inventory system. This may mean our inventory counts may be inaccurate.

For the purpose of our final project, we will assume contributers will add books to the system when they are added to the box and consumers will remove the book from the system when they are removed from the box.
